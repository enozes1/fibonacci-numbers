# Fibonacci in Ruby

This repository contains two implementations of the Fibonacci sequence algorithm in Ruby.

## Implementations

### 1. Iterative (`fibonacci_iterative.rb`)

This version uses an iterative approach to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.

*   **Speed:** Fast
*   **Output:** Displays the entire Fibonacci sequence up to a desired length.

### 2. Recursive (`fibonacci_recursive.rb`)

This version uses a recursive approach to calculate a specific number in the Fibonacci sequence.

*   **Speed:** Slow (especially for higher numbers)
*   **Output:** Displays the single Fibonacci number at a specified position.

## Usage

To run either script, use the `ruby` command followed by the filename:

```bash
ruby fibonacci_iterative.rb
```
or

```bash
ruby fibonacci_iterative.rb 10
```

```bash
ruby fibonacci_recursive.rb
```
or

```bash
ruby fibonacci_recursive.rb 10
```

The scripts will prompt you to enter the desired length or position.
